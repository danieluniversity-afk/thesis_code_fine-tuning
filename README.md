# thesis_code_fine-tuning
My name is Daniel Iahr and this is my masters project at Tilburg University 2024. You can find here the code for my thesis on fine-tuning LLMs.  

## LLM Fine-Tuning & Evaluation Pipeline
A two-part project for fine-tuning and evaluating large language models:

### Notebooks:
  1. finetune_LLM_step_by_step.ipynb
    -Data preprocessing and cleaning
    -Implementation of different fine-tuning strategies
    -Preparation of training and testing datasets
     
  2. EvaluateNotebook.ipynb
    -Response generation from pretrained and fine-tuned models
    -Evaluation using multiple metrics:
        BERTScore (semantic similarity)
        Syntactic similarity
        Lexical diversity (MTLD)
        Sentiment analysis

### Usage
-Update file paths and names in both notebooks
-Run notebooks in sequence
-Review generated statistics and visualizations
